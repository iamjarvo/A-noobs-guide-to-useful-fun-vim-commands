Adding an item a certain amount of times
Example: Css comments /***/. Display 20 * across
```
20*ia<Esc>
```

Adding an item a certain amount of times separated by a charcter
Example: An array of 11 letter "0"s
```
11iao,<Esc>x
```
Basically its the same as outputting a certain amount of characters, just hitting x at the end to take out the last character.
